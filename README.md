# <E-Commerce Site>

## Description

As someone who is running an e-commerce site, it can be very difficult to manage my inventory.
This is what motivated me to create an application that allows me to handle customer transactions!
By calling our API endpoint, I am able to view, add, update, and delete my product categories, products, and product tags.

In building this application, I learned a lot about object relational mappers (ORM) as well as creating asychronous routes and seeding data.
